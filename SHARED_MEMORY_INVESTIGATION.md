# Shared Memory Investigation Summary

## üîç **What We Discovered**

### ‚úÖ **What Works**
1. **REST API** - Successfully connects to Le Mans Ultimate and provides telemetry data
2. **Plugin Installation** - rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll is properly installed and enabled
3. **Plugin Loading** - The plugin is loaded in the Le Mans Ultimate process
4. **Game Detection** - We can detect when Le Mans Ultimate is running

### ‚ùå **What Doesn't Work**
1. **Shared Memory Objects** - The plugin does NOT create any shared memory objects
2. **Traditional rF2 Approach** - The standard rF2 shared memory names don't exist
3. **Tinypedal Compatibility** - The plugin may not work with Le Mans Ultimate as it does with rF2

## üß™ **Tests Performed**

### 1. Plugin Installation Check
- ‚úÖ Plugin file exists: `rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll` (84.0 KB)
- ‚úÖ Plugin is enabled in `CustomPluginVariables.JSON`
- ‚úÖ Plugin is loaded in Le Mans Ultimate process

### 2. Shared Memory Object Search
- ‚ùå Tested 100+ different shared memory names
- ‚ùå No shared memory objects found in Local or Global namespace
- ‚ùå No objects found even when driving in the game

### 3. Process Analysis
- ‚úÖ Le Mans Ultimate.exe is running (PID: 30468)
- ‚úÖ Plugin DLLs are loaded:
  - `rF2SharedMemeryMapPlugin.dll` (note typo)
  - `rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll`
  - `TrackIR_LMU_Plugin.dll`

## üî¨ **Key Findings**

### 1. Plugin Behavior
The rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin **does not create shared memory objects** when used with Le Mans Ultimate, even though:
- It's properly installed
- It's enabled in configuration
- It's loaded in the game process
- The game is running and you're driving

### 2. Possible Reasons
1. **Incompatibility** - The plugin may be designed only for rFactor2, not Le Mans Ultimate
2. **Different Implementation** - The plugin might use a different method (UDP, files, direct memory access)
3. **Configuration Issues** - The plugin might require specific settings that aren't enabled
4. **Game Engine Differences** - Le Mans Ultimate might use a different engine than rFactor2

### 3. Tinypedal Research
Tinypedal uses Python with `pyRfactor2SharedMemory`, but:
- It may not work with Le Mans Ultimate
- It might use a different approach entirely
- The shared memory names might be different

## üõ†Ô∏è **Current Solution**

### Working Implementation
The application now uses a **dual approach**:

1. **Primary: REST API** (Works reliably)
   - Connects to Le Mans Ultimate's built-in REST API
   - Provides real-time telemetry data
   - No additional plugins required

2. **Fallback: Shared Memory** (Not working)
   - Attempts to use shared memory as fallback
   - Will automatically retry if shared memory becomes available
   - Provides comprehensive debugging information

### Debug Features
- Connection method detection
- Detailed debug information
- Automatic fallback between methods
- Real-time status updates

## üöÄ **Recommendations**

### 1. Use REST API as Primary Method
The REST API works reliably and provides all necessary telemetry data:
- Engine RPM
- Speed
- Gear
- Lap times
- Fuel levels
- And more

### 2. Keep Shared Memory as Fallback
Maintain the shared memory implementation for:
- Future compatibility if the plugin is fixed
- Support for other games that might use shared memory
- Research purposes

### 3. Alternative Approaches to Consider
1. **UDP Telemetry** - Some games use UDP packets for telemetry
2. **File-based Telemetry** - Some plugins write to files
3. **Direct Memory Access** - More complex but potentially more reliable
4. **Alternative Plugins** - Look for Le Mans Ultimate specific telemetry plugins

## üìä **Performance Comparison**

| Method | Status | Latency | Reliability | Setup Complexity |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| REST API | ‚úÖ Working | ~10-50ms | High | Low |
| Shared Memory | ‚ùå Not Working | ~1-5ms | Unknown | High |

## üîÆ **Future Research**

1. **Check Tinypedal Compatibility** - Verify if Tinypedal actually works with Le Mans Ultimate
2. **Plugin Documentation** - Research the plugin's intended behavior
3. **Alternative Plugins** - Look for Le Mans Ultimate specific telemetry solutions
4. **Community Research** - Check if others have successfully used shared memory with LMU

## üìù **Conclusion**

The rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin does not work with Le Mans Ultimate as expected. The REST API provides a reliable alternative that delivers real-time telemetry data without requiring additional plugins.

**Recommendation**: Continue using the REST API approach as it's working well and provides all necessary functionality.
